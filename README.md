# The Great McDonalds Battle
You are an underage McDonalds worker, flipping burgers for small pay. One day, an angry woman walks through the door and complains that her burger was undercooked.
No one listens to her, and she starts destroying the restaurant and attacking people! Can you stop her before she destroys the entire restaurant?

This project was originally my Create Performance Task project from the AP Computer Science Principles course.<br>
However, it could only be played in the console at the time. Using my knowledge of Flask and my beginner frontend skills, I made a functioning web version of my original text-based console game.
